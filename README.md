# Autonomous Garbage Collection Robot

## Overview
Addressing India's escalating garbage crisis, this project introduces an Autonomous Garbage Collection Robot designed for efficient waste management. It's an innovative response to the challenges posed by traditional waste collection methods and aims to support the initiatives like Swachh Bharath Abhiyan.

## Context
Indian cities generate over 100 million tons of solid waste annually, and existing waste management programs are not sufficiently addressing this issue. Traditional garbage collection methods pose health risks to workers and are often inefficient. Moreover, the use of AI and robotics in waste management is limited.

## Solution
The Autonomous Garbage Collection Robot is designed for automatic garbage collection in confined spaces, like laboratories. It leverages sensors to navigate and differentiate between static and dynamic obstacles, collecting and disposing of waste efficiently.

## Features
- **Automatic Garbage Detection**: Identifies when trash bins are full and need emptying.
- **Advanced Navigation**: Utilizes sensors to avoid obstacles and navigate through designated areas.
- **Designated Disposal**: Capable of disposing of garbage to pre-specified locations.
- **Health and Safety**: Reduces health hazards associated with manual waste collection.

## Goals
- To offer a sustainable and efficient solution to India's waste management problem.
- To improve health and safety standards for waste management workers.
- To incorporate modern technology like AI and robotics into waste management practices.

## Future Scope
This project opens avenues for further advancements in AI and robotics for waste management, aiming to create smarter and more efficient cities.
